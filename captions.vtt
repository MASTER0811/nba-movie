the warriors currently find themselves

209
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.560
in the position of questioning their

210
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.119
title chase

211
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.560
on the other side the boston celtics see

212
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.120
themselves as the latest pedigree of a

213
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.640
long championship tradition

237
00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.240
to close out hard but stay in front

238
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.440

256
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.320
inside the table tatum turns at the

257
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.480
elbow tough shot on peyton is good

258
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.120

265
00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:25.839
and help position curry no way back to

266
00:11:25.839 --> 00:11:27.600

the force of the energy is fantastic

277
00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.880
that's the whole key against these guys

278
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.200
we gotta get their defense to move and

279
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.200
then all you guys can attack the rim at

280
00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.519
that point without florida clay play

281
00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:00.399

00:30:08.399 --> 00:30:10.159
it means everything knowing the sense of

677
00:30:10.159 --> 00:30:12.640
urgency we had to have tonight

678
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:15.039
we feed off of that energy and that fire

679
00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:17.039
and that fire was

680
00:30:17.039 --> 00:30:19.540
me just trying to show that we're here

681
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:22.680
[Music]

682
00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.840
what i've found is you go to the finals

683
00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.039
and you just lock in on the next game

684
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:36.000
whichever team executes better and plays

685
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.080
with more force over the seven games

686
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:39.679
assuming the teams are evenly matched

687
00:30:39.679 --> 00:30:41.360
like they are in this series

688
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:45.320
that's the team that's gonna win

689
00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.159
the celtics and the warriors the 2022

690
00:30:56.159 --> 00:30:58.399
finals it could not be more even each

691
00:30:58.399 --> 00:31:01.279
team with a home win and a road win each

692
00:31:01.279 --> 00:31:04.320
team scoring 105 points a game each team

693
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.279
with 64 made threes something's gotta

694
00:31:07.279 --> 00:31:10.000
give in the pivotal game five

695
00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
yes sir back at home

696
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.919
nice to get this one take control of the

697
00:31:13.919 --> 00:31:14.960
series

698
00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.200
see what happens

699
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.679
boston 7-0 following a loss in these

700
00:31:19.679 --> 00:31:23.519
playoffs bouncing back as a way of life

701
00:31:23.519 --> 00:31:25.039
coming off that loss

702
00:31:25.039 --> 00:31:26.960
instead of separating we got to be even

703
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.240
closer together

704
00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.760
it's not going to be the same every game

705
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:30.399
you know they're going to make

706
00:31:30.399 --> 00:31:31.679
adjustments you're going to make

707
00:31:31.679 --> 00:31:33.279
adjustments to their adjustments and

708
00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:35.679
most is three games left so leave it all

709
00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:36.960
out there

710
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.120
one of these teams is leaving tonight a

711
00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.799
win away from an nba championship

712
00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.720
when it comes to the exit of those i

713
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.120
don't think i've ever went into a game

714
00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.120
and i felt like the opposing team was

715
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.360
more prepared than we were

716
00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.200
and i think that is a testament to coach

717
00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:56.720
kerr and his coaching ability

718
00:31:56.799 --> 00:31:58.799
steve kerr once again

719
00:31:58.799 --> 00:32:01.760
has shown us adjustments sometimes could

720
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:04.240
be a mind game versus a physical game

721
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.320
because he understands his trust like

722
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:10.439
michael jordan had trusted him

723
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.919
hands back jordan here's six on the shot

724
00:32:17.919 --> 00:32:19.919
jordan keeps it dribble jordan finds

725
00:32:19.919 --> 00:32:22.720
george hits kerr

726
00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:26.960
my experience as a player definitely

727
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.679
helped me prepare to to coach a team in

728
00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:31.279
the finals because i know what these

729
00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:33.440
guys are feeling

730
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.480
this guy like 25 years ago tonight he

731
00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.180
hit the shot

732
00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.000
[Applause]

733
00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.880

734
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.120
all this cachet that stuff does matter

735
00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.320
it does worry me it's a celtic thing

736
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.190
[Applause]

737
00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:23.279
[Applause]

738
00:33:23.279 --> 00:33:25.200
green brings to the table

739
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.279
energy effort

740
00:33:27.279 --> 00:33:29.840
sacrificing his body

741
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.880
let's go drake great start

742
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.200
offensively we're playing too soft

743
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.480
basically trying to be more physical

744
00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.399
we're four for 11 in the paint we talked

745
00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:39.919
about the floating shot client go up

746
00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:42.000

748
00:33:43.519 --> 00:33:46.159

750
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.519

751
00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:54.159
marcus smart muscles him no luck

752
00:33:54.159 --> 00:33:56.159
austin took an early punch now fighting

753
00:33:56.159 --> 00:33:57.200
back well

754
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.440
rob williams off the window and in

755
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.559

756
00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:04.240
